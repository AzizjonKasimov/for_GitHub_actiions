# for_GitHub_actions
This repository is just to test GitHub Actions.

The main file that you need to run GitHub actions is located in .github/workflows. You need to write your workflow logic in YAML file, which is in that repository. You can have multiple YAML which can be triggered for different actions.

Note: Keep in mind that when an action is running, if you are using some files to run the code inside of them, then the paths in the codes should be changed to the relative path of the repository.
